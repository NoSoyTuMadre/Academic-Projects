Software Engineering - CRM System Proposal:<br>
Using an initial requirements document for a proposed video game company, I prepared a proposal for a custom-built customer relationship management (CRM) system, as a solution to the companyâ€™s needs. Using Adobe XD, I prepared a mock design of the graphical user interface for company review and input. I prepared in the proposal documentation, procedures to test and implement the system for the sales force.
