<strong>Software Engineering - CRM System Proposal:</strong><br>
Using an initial requirements document for a proposed video game company, I prepared a proposal for a custom-built customer relationship management (CRM) system, as a solution to the companyâ€™s needs. Using Adobe XD, I prepared a mock design of the graphical user interface for company review and input. I prepared in the proposal documentation, procedures to test and implement the system for the sales force.

<strong>Software I - Inventory Management System App:</strong><br>
Using IntelliJ IDE and JavaFX, I created an inventory management system for a proposed manufacturing company that utilized a graphical user interface, table views, search functions, and exception controls that would allow a user to manipulate products, parts, and inventory count using the user interface.

<strong>Software II - Appointment Scheduling App:</strong><br>
Using IntelliJ IDE and JavaFX, I created a scheduling desktop user interface application that pulls data from a remote MySQL database server. This application incorporated a fully functional graphical calendar that can alternate from a monthly to weekly view with appointments listed for each day. Pop-up windows for detailed customer information, detailed appointment information, alerts, reports, error control messages, and exception control messages were utilized as well. A localization API and date/time API were used to include users with different languages and from different regions of the world. Lambda expressions and collections were used, as well as customized reports and log files were generated as part of the application.

<strong>Data Structures & Algorithms II - Package Delivery App:</strong><br>
Using PyCharm and Python, I created a package delivery application that extracts and formats data from three CSV files (one with location information, one with package information, and one with distance information) into a usable format from a CSV file. The information from these files were used to create the class structures throughout the app. A command-line user interface was utilized to allow a user to view the current status and/or package details of one or all packages. A custom hash table class and a K-nearest neighbor algorithm was incorporated for optimization, based on shortest total mileage traveled by all trucks.
