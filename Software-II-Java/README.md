# Software II - Appointment Scheduling App
Using IntelliJ IDE and JavaFX, I created a scheduling desktop user interface application that pulls data from a remote MySQL database server. This application incorporated a fully functional graphical calendar that can alternate from a monthly to weekly view with appointments listed for each day. Pop-up windows for detailed customer information, detailed appointment information, alerts, reports, error control messages, and exception control messages were utilized as well. A localization API and date/time API were used to include users with different languages and from different regions of the world. Lambda expressions and collections were used, as well as customized reports and log files were generated as part of the application.
